What are we doing?
 - We are working on behalf of Tanzania's Ministry of Water to help predict which water pumps across the country are functional, completely broken or in need of some sort of maintenance. 
 - We are also collaborating with Taarifa, an open-source web API that offers a lot of data on this particular problem. 
 - Our goal is to best predict issues with water pumps to promote greater access to clean water across Tanzania, an issue plaguing much of the country. 
 - Our idea of success would be to achieve a predictive accuracy of greater than 80% and to be able to give the Tanzanian Ministry of Water some key insights into which factors put a strain on pumps and how to best avoid them breaking down.
