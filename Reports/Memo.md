Hello Stakeholders!

 + A summary of the business problem we are trying to solve:

 - We are working on behalf of Tanzania's Ministry of Water to help predict which water pumps across the country are functional, completely broken or in need of some sort of maintenance. 
 
 - We are also collaborating with Taarifa, an open-source web API that offers a lot of data on this particular problem. 
 
 - Our goal is to best predict issues with water pumps to promote greater access to clean water across Tanzania, an issue plaguing much of the country. 
 
 - Our idea of success would be to achieve a classification accuracy of greater than 75% and to be able to give the Tanzanian Ministry of Water some key insights into which factors put a strain on pumps and how to best avoid them breaking down. We would like to place emphasis on correctly classifying pumps in need of repair as this is significantly cheaper than installing new pumps altogether. We will also identify regions where a large majority of the pumps are non-functional which the Ministry can then target as a problematic area as a whole. 


 + Key takeaways from your solution:

- Waterpoint types - The type of waterpoint used is a good indicator of how durable it will be down the line. When installing new pumps, communal standpipes and handpumps are the ones that will serve the community the best. The ministry should avoid deploying other types of waterpoint such as cattle troughs or dams.

- Population - In areas with high density populations, pumps need to be maintained more regularly and overall, more pumps need to be deployed over a larger area of land. 24.6 million inhabitants lack access to clean water, that is almost half of the countryâ€™s population!

- Location - Pumps in certain regions seem to display a higher level of malfunction - this needs to be looked into deeper. We have noticed for example that pumps located near mountains are prone to malfunction, perhaps givent the altitude and more energy required to pump the water higher and also the freezing temperatures leading to the pumps breaking. However in temperate, low altitude areas, pumps generally function much better.

- Water quality - This feature is a strong indicator or whether or not a pump will break down. Areas with soft water lead to the fewest issues with pump functionality whereas salty or milky water lead to a lot of issues with pumps breaking down. Aiming to avoid such areas will help ensure the maximal lifespan of the pumps.

- Operational life and water availability - Areas with low amounts of available water eventually tend to malfunction or require repairs. New pumps should not be located in areas which do not have consistent flows of water available to them as it will likely be in vain. Additionally, our data showed that pumps over the operational age of 20 are on average non-functional therefore inspections and maintenance of older pumps is essential to improve access to clean water across Tanzania. 


 + A section on next steps if you had more time (i.e. one additional week)

 - We would like to compare similar data on surrounding countries with a similar level of economic development and topography/geography to train our model further and uncover new insights.
 - Also we would have liked to discuss the make of the pumps deployed and have more information on that from the funders/installers
